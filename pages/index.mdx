Hey, I'm a aspiring game programmer/game designer, recently graduated from university.
I primarily work with Unity and C# for development, and have experience using Python
and JavaScript in other projects as well.

My love for programming, video games and design fuels everything I do, and I hope this
portfolio is able to showcase that!
