Unreleased project I worked on during my time at Starpixel as the sole programmer and game designer. Seven Times To Die is a 2D deckbuilder action RPG with 
realtime card combat mechanics. Originally conceived as a iteration on Vampire Survivors, I revised it into a realtime action card battler with a focus on 
the complexity of deckbuilding and combat mechanics to align with the change in project direction. Game design and gameplay system implementation was completely done by me alone.

The sections below expand more on the core features I worked on. Many of these systems were supposed to be expanded/added on to at a later date.
