Leap of Legends is a 3D side scrolling platformer made in Unity for my university's Game Engine Essentials module. 
For this group project, I took on the role of project lead and gameplay programmer, coordinating the development
tasks, technical design and guiding my team members by virtue of my extensive prior experience developing in Unity.

I did the implementation of most of the player controller, combat system, game mechanics and their integration with our 
backend manager classes, as well as data persistence/serialization of the player's progress and current game state to a file
when they reach a checkpoint, using the Newtonsoft JSON package to do so.
