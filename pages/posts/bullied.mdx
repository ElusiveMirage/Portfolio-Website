For my final year group project, my team and I were tasked with developing a game for the Oculus/Vive VR headsets. 
We settled on creating a narrative experience focused on the topic of bullying/students with troubled families, where 
you briefly see the world in the eyes of the main character for a day. The project was developed in Unreal Engine 4, and 
is relatively simple in terms of features, with player interaction mainly consisting of walking, jumping, making dialogue 
choices in cutscenes and interacting with objects. My main contributions to this project were in developing the dialogue/choice system, 
implementing NPC animations and pathfinding, and scripting the cutscene animations. I also helped with storyboarding and overall game design.
