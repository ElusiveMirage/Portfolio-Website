During my internship at the Housing Development Board, I was tasked with continuing the development of HDB’s virtual reality project, 
the Participatory Design Tool, an Unity application developed for the HTC Vive where the user can interact with and place objects in a 3D scene 
to create a design of an simulated environment for people to view. 

This application was developed to be used by HDB’s Community Relations Group, to better allow HDB residents to visualise potential changes 
in the common spaces of their residential estate. The virtual reality Participatory Design Tool served as a immersive technological solution 
to simulating these possible or proposed designs that will help the residents to get an idea of how outcome of these changes would be like and
directly partipate in this design process during focus group discussions and public engagement events.

This project was previously created and developed by the 2 previous batches of interns before me, and I was tasked with continuing the development 
of the project. Over the course of my internship, I made significant improvements to the project, fixing existing bugs, reimplementing old features 
and adding new ones, improving the UX/UI and general code optimisations, eventually culminating in a stable, polished prototype with all the necessary 
features to be presented to the public and internally within the organisation.
